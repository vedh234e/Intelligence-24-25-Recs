TASK1A

In this script, we fine-tuned a pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model for binary image classification using PyTorch. We prepared and augmented image data, replaced the model's classification layer to output a single value, and trained it using BCEWithLogitsLoss with the Adam optimizer. The model's accuracy and loss were tracked during training, and the final weights were saved for future use.
